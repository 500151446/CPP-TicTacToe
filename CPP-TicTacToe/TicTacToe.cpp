//not sure what we need this for
//main already generically handles games and all the logic for tictactoe is contained within the tictactoe class as it should be

// Was this meant to contain logic for the game and the class was just meant to hold data? 
// That doesn't seem to be the case because the TicTacToe class contains a "TakeTurn" function
// if the tictactoe class is meant to "Display" and "TakeTurn" then what else is there left to do?

// I feel like I'm missing something but I just don't see what it would be.
